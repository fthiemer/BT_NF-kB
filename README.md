# BT_NF-kB
The Scripts used in my bachelor thesis "Bioinformatic Prediction of NF-kB Target Genes in the Human Genome."

The scripts in this dictionary need several modules to be installed to work properly. For a guide on how to install them you can check https://automatetheboringstuff.com/appendixa/ . This ressource is taken from the book "Automate the boring stuff with python", by Al Sweigart, which was my main ressource for learning the python that can be found in this repository. It is available for free on https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc

The list of the used modules can be found in the methodology section of the thesis.
An additional dependency is geckodriver for your specific OS ( https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases ). All scripts should be able to run on Windows and MacOS, Linux was not tested.

The script for Figure 6 required some non-automatic steps, which are described in the comments of the script.
